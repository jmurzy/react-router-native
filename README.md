# React Router Native [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/jmurzy/react-router-native.svg?style=flat-square)](https://circleci.com/gh/jmurzy/react-router-native) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-native.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-native) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react-router-native.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-router-native/blob/master/LICENSE.md) [![Discord Channel](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-react--router@reactiflux-738bd7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46)

A routing library for [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) that strives for sensible API parity with [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/).

### Motivation
- Knowledge and proven idioms from react-router can be reused while extending them as necessary to allow navigation semantics unique to native platforms
- Possibility to share routing code for react web / native codebases
- Deep linking
- URL Driven Development

**Note**: This project contains components that are currently under [active](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=ericvicenti) [development](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=hedgerwang) and considered experimentalâ€”aka use in production at your own risk. Documentation is still a [work-in-progress](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-router-native/issues), and pull requests are accepted gratefully!


### Example
The example app from the GIF can be found at `examples/Aviato`. You can run it as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmurzy/react-router-native && cd react-router-native
cd examples/Aviato
npm install
react-native run-ios
```

Look at `examples/Aviato/app/routes.js` and play around with the app to get a feel for what's possible.

### Installation

Do not let npm confuse you: there used to be another project with the same name that the previous owner nuked. Unfortunately, removing or re-publishing old versions is no longer supported by npm. So the packages that are currently available on npm *are the artifacts of a different project*, and the first version of this library *will be released as __v2.0.0__* and strictly follow [React Versioning Scheme](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html) afterwards.

For now, it's only available on Github until it has reached a minimum viable stability ðŸš€. 

### Usage

```javascript
import { Router, Route, render } from 'react-router-native';

const APP_KEY = 'app'

const App = (props) => (/*...*/);
const About = (props) => (/*...*/);
const AboutHeader = (props) => (/*...*/);
const Users = (props) => (/*...*/);
const User = (props) => (/*...*/);
const UserHeader = (props) => (/*...*/);
const NoMatch = (props) => (/*...*/);

render((
  /* Address Bar can be toggled on or off by setting the addressBar prop */
  <Router addressBar>
    <TabsRoute
      path="app"
      component={App}
      transition="horizontal-pager"
    >
      <Route path="/" component={About} overlayComponent={AboutHeader}/>
      <Route path="users" component={Users} overlayComponent={UserHeader}>
        <Route path="/user/:userId" component={User}/>
      </Route>
      <Route path="*" component={NoMatch}/>
    </TabsRoute>
  </Router>
), APP_KEY);
```

### Advanced Usage

You can customize behavior of the default reducers that are used to create the `navigationState` of `<Route>` or its siblings.

This allows greater customizations on how `<Link>` behaves for a particular route and is especially useful for nested `<StackRoute>`'s where default action doesn't always lead to the intended behavior, or `<TabsRoute>`'s where double-taps should reset the `navigationState` of a nested `<StackRoute>`.

```js
const reducer = (
  state: EnhancedNavigationState,
  action: NavigationAction
): EnhancedNavigationState => ({
  /* ... */
});

<TabsRoute path="/" component={Component} reducer={reducer}/>
```

### Platform Support

React Router Native is cross-platform. It supports all platforms that [NavigationExperimental](https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc) supports.

### Contributing
In order to hack on the library code and sync it into `examples/Aviato/node_modules` run `npm run sync` (depends on `npm i -g sane`). The library code is specified as a [local dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#local-paths) in the example's [`package.json`](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-router-native/blob/master/examples/Aviato/package.json) -- `npm link` does not work with RN packager right now (it's an [open issue](https://productpains.com/post/react-native/symlink-support-for-packager/)).

We look forward to your input! ðŸ‘Š
